# advent-of-code

My advent of code solutions in [Go](https://go.dev). 

## Structure
Code is organised by year then day:
```
.\[year]
  .\day[dd]
    .\day[dd].txt
    .\input.txt
    .\day[dd].go
    .\day[dd]_test.go
```

## Testing
It is intended you can run the tests from the root:
`go test ./2021/01/.`

## Objectives
Practice solving puzzles with Go and hopefully get 25 stars!
