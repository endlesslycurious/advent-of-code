# advent-of-code

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in [Go](https://go.dev). 

## Structure
Code is organised by year then day:
```
.\[year]
  .\day[dd]
    .\day[dd].txt
    .\input.txt
    .\day[dd].go
    .\day[dd]_test.go
```

## Testing
It is intended you run the tests from the repository root:

`go test ./2021/01/.`


## Benchmarking
You also run the benchmarks from the repository root:

`go test ./2021/01/. --bench .`

## Progress
Hoping to get at least 25 of 50 possible stars!
