# Advent-of-Code

My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in various programming languages, I tend to work on problems all year round not just during advent itself.

## Languages

In general I've tried to use tests to verify my solutions as I write them.

### Go

Go (v1.29) seemed pretty good for working on these problems being higher lever than C++ although I did feel like generics may have made a few solutions simpler. Will need to revisit these at some point..

### C++

My first time using a non-proprietary build system in over a decade, spent a fair bit of time experimenting with `cmake` and `make` to get something I could live with. C++ being a lower level language its string handling feels verbose compared to Go or Python. I chose to use `assert` rather than pulling in a dedicated unit test framework.

### Python

As a high level language python is well suited to these sorts of problems featuring string oriented data, the resulting solutions are pleasingly terse even with tests included.
