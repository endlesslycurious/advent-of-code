# Advent of Code 2024

My [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions in [Python](https://python.org).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.13.*
- Poetry 1.8.*

## Creating days
Use the provided `create-day.sh` shell script to create the structure for a new day from day `00`:
```
create-day.sh 01
```

## Structure
Code is organised by day in subfolders:
```
.\[dd]
  .\README.md
  .\day[dd].py
  .\input_day[dd].txt
  .\test_day[dd].txt
```

## Progress
Hoping to get at least 25 of 50 possible stars!
