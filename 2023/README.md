# Advent of Code 2023 in C++ 

Trying to keep things simple, see (day) `00` folder for simplest example:
- Make file for building with C++ 20.
- Assert macro for testing.
- Header file for inputs.

## Makefile Targets
- `clean` to delete the temp files and output.
- `dir` to create the temp build directory.
- `build` to build the project.
- `run` to run the program.
- `all` to do all of the above!
